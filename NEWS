* Olena 1.0	July 14, 2009

	* The core C++ library, renamed to Milena, has been rewritten from
	  scratch and features numerous additions over the past releases.
	  Some features have also been dropped or disabled, and some of them
	  will be reintegrated in future releases.  The programming
	  interface has changed from previous versions, but most programs
	  using Olena 0.11 can be adapted to the Olena 1.0 API.

	* Milena uses a simplified version of the SCOOP 2 paradigm
	  (informally called SCOOP 1.5), to improve the speed of compilation
	  and make developing easier while still providing very good
	  run-time performances.

	* A first (re)implementation of Swilena featuring Python wrappers
	  for a very small subset of Milena is available.  The bundled
	  Swilena Python Shell (sps) allows interactive Olena sessions.

	* A reference documentation including a tutorial and a quick
	  reference guide have been started.  They do not cover the whole
	  Milena library yet.

	* Olena includes some demos and applications using Milena.


* Olena 0.11	February 21, 2007

	* The whole Olena distribution compiles with the GNU C++
	  Compiler (G++) 4.0 and 4.1.  The compatibility with previous
	  versions of the compiler has been broken.

	* Revamp of Swilena.
	  The Swilena wrappers have been repaired, as they had become
	  incompatible with recent versions of SWIG, G++, Python and Ruby.
	  Moreover, a lot of small bugs have been fixed in Swilena.
	  The test suite of Rblena, the Ruby wrappers for Olena, has
	  been completed and is comparable to Pylena's (the Python
	  wrappers for Olena).

	* Libtool.
	  The whole package uses GNU Libtool to handle libraries.
	  Swilena benefits this, and uses Libtool to create shared
	  libraries upon which SWIG wrappers are built.

	* Miscellaneous corrections in Olena and Integre, as well as in
	  their test suites.


* Olena 0.10	April 15, 2004

	* New documentation system.
	  Now any comment should use Doxygen style (i.e. /*! ... */).
	  You can also write some programs inside the comments. They are
	  compiled at documentation generation time. It is useful to
	  illustrate some algorithms with concrete input and output. To
	  use this feature the program has to be between \code and \endcode
	  tags. If you produce an image, you can include it in the comments
	  with the \image command, using the same name you used to produce
	  it, but with the png extension. To make sure your image will not
	  overwrite another existing one, you should name it taking care of
	  the namespace you are using: e.g. if you comment the function
	  oln::boo::bar::fun, the image should be named oln_foo_bar_fun.ppm.
	  The macros IMG_IN and IMG_OUT correspond to the path of the images.

	* Border behavior can be controlled with the behavior hierarchy.
	  If an algorithm support it, you can choose the way the image
	  border will be seen. Three behaviors are available: mirror,
	  replicate or user defined value.

	* Attribute opening/closing enhancement
	  - Make the algorithm more generic.
	  - Add a lot of attributes (area, disk, square, dist,
	    rectangle, volume, height, maxvalue, minvalue).

	* Change the color conversion system
	  - CIE RGB is the main color system i.e. it can be converted
	    directly into any other color system.
	  - Conversion between 2 color systems should pass by the RGB one.

	* Generic and concrete morphers are now implemented in Olena.
	  - Five morphers are included in this release:
		 Color morpher
		 Sub quantifying morpher
		 Piece morpher
		 Iter morpher
		 Slicing morpher
	  - These morphers can be manipulated as if they were normal images.


* Olena 0.9	August 8, 2003

	* New static hierarchy paradigm
	  - Complete rewrite of the image hierarchy.
	  - The new hierarchy benefits from multiple inheritance and
	    diamond constructs.
	  - Objects' abstract interfaces made available, leading to
	    safer and easier algorithm writing.
	  - Label images such as binary_image or vectorial_image added.

	* Partial rewrite of images I/O
	  - Support for 1d, 3d images and windows.
	  - Better handling of built-in types.

	* Color conversions fixed and improved.

	* Cleanup and coding style conformance.

	* Many bug fixes.
	* Improved test-suite.


* Olena 0.8	April 10, 2003

	IMPORTANT NOTE: This version is not compatible with older
	versions of Olena. The project has been split into three part,
	so many header files have moved and new namespaces have been
	created. Please read the UPGRADING file for more information.

	* Many source code cleanups.
	* The source code has been split into 3 parts: image
	  processing (olena/), data types (integre/) and meta-programming
	  tools (metalic/).
	* First part of the new static hierarchy paradigm implementation.
	* Support for combinatorial maps.
	* Many bug fixes.


* Olena 0.7	February 10, 2003

	* Manual pages for the command-line utilities.
	* New, saner, source tree layout.
	* Each `part' of the source tree can be excluded from the
	  build process with configuration flags.
	* New `oln.m4' file for use by autoconf'ed user projects.
	* Major documentation updates.
	* New `oln-config.sh' scripts for user Makefiles.
	* Olena now works on Mac OS X, NetBSD, FreeBSD and Cygwin.


* Olena 0.6	January 15, 2003

	* Complete rewriting of data types.
	* Command line utilities.
	* Fully implementation of convolutions

* Olena 0.5	July 25, 2002

	* Documentation in LaTeX (instead of Texinfo).
	* Support reading/writing gziped images
	  (include <oln/io/gz.hh> and link with libz).
	* Complete rewrite of the static arrays
	  (meta::array1d, meta::array2d, meta::array3d).
	* Preliminary implementation of convolutions
	  (oln::convol::convolve)
	* All headers should now be referenced with the `oln/' prefix,
	  as in `#include <oln/basics2d.hh>'.
	* New conversion operator: convert::stretch.
	* Many bug fixes.

* Olena 0.2	November 28, 2001

	* Color:
	  - nrgb_8, nrgb_16, nrgb_32: new types for NTSC RGB.  The
	    conversion from and to YIQ and HSI which assumed NTSC RGB
	    has been adjusted to actually use nrgb_* (instead of rgb_*)
	    and renamed accordingly.
	  - yuv_8, yuv_16, yuv_32: New types.

	  The currently available conversions are

		    hsi   yuv
		      \  /
	       rgb -- nrgb
		\     /  \
		  xyz     yiq

	* Various cleanups and bug fixes.  Especially:
	  - border handling (mirroring, copying) simplified and fixed.
	  - ++k, --k: return a value with the same type as k.

	* I/O:
	  - pnm/P1, pnm/P3, and pnm/P6 support for image_3d.


* Olena 0.1f	November 22, 2001

	* Core:
	  - Several bug fixes in memory handling.

	* Types:
	  - New color types: HSI, YIQ; with conversions to and from RGB.
	  - `min()' and `max()' are now defined with the types (i.e.
	    not in math/macros.hh), along with the other operators.
	    Also, these procedures will two arguments of different
	    types.

	* Casts:
	  - `cast::round': similar to C's round()
	  - `cast::rbound': ditto, but constrained to fit the
	    output type's range.

	* I/O:
	  - Support for `image_3d<int_u<N> >' (as PNM P2 & P5).

	* Processings
	  - `level::is_greater_or_equal', `level::is_greater',
	    `level::is_lower_or_equal', `level::is_lower',
	    `level::is_equal': Comparisons between images.
	  - `level::connected_component': Number connected components.
	  - `morpho::geodesic_dilation', `morpho::simple_geodesic_dilation'.
	  - `morpho::geodesic_erosion', `morpho::simple_geodesic_erosion'.
	  - `morpho::get_plus_se_only', `morpho::get_plus_se_p',
	    `morpho::get_minus_se_only', `morpho::get_minus_se_p': Split
	    a structural element in a `plus' (lexically before than the center)
	    and `minus' (after).

	* Misc:
	  - `utils::timer': for benchmarking
	  - `level::lut', `level::hlut': Lookup tables.


* Olena 0.1d	November 15, 2001

	* Core:
	  - `point's, `dpoint's, and `image_size's feature a `nth()' method,
	    that returns the value of the nth coordinate.
	  - `fold': new high order operator.

	* Types:
	  - `vec<N,T>' uses an array to store its elements
	    and accepts builtin types.
	  - `rgb<T>' has been replaced by `rgb_8', `rgb_16', `rgb_32'
	  - `xyz_8', `xyz_16', `xyz_32' are new types.
	  - the latter six types are instances of the `color' type.

	* Processings:
	  - All basic morphological processings (`opening',
	    `hit_or_miss', `beucher_gradient', etc.) from namespace
	    `morpho::' have their fast equivalent in namespace
	    `morpho::fast::'.
	  - `convert::apply' is similar to `apply' but will work
	    for all types of conversions while `apply' can only work
	    on `conversion_to_type' conversions.

	* Tools:
	  - `utils::fill': fill an image
	  - `utils::f_moments', `utils::f_minmax': statistical functors.

	* Casts:
	  - `cast::bound': similar to `convert::bound'.

	* I/O:
	  - It's possible to load and save as PPM any kind of image2d
	    whose color has 3 components on 8 bits.


* Olena 0.1b	November 8, 2001

	* New type: rgb<T>

	* New processings:
	  - morpho::watershed_con
	  - convol::fast::gaussian
	  - convol::fast::gaussian_derivative
	  - convol::fast::gaussian_second_derivative

	* Conversion are organized in the following hierarchy

	    conversion<Inferior>
		  ^
		  |
	    conversion_to_type<To,Inferior>
		  ^
		  |
	    conversion_from_type_to_type<From,To,Inferior>

	  All children of conversion_from_type_to_type are models of
	  Adaptable Unary Function.  See conversion.hh for more comments.

	* The only two functions that perform file i/o are `load' and
	  `save'.  The other functions (`read', `write', `read_pnm',
	  `write_pnm') have been removed.

	* image2d<rgb<int_u8> > can be loaded and saved as ppm.

	* All iterators support a new method, cur(), that returns
	  the current point (or dpoint).  It is meant to be used
	  at places where the compiler is unable to implicitly convert
	  an iterator into a point (or dpoint).

	* Bug fixes:
	  - Olena now compiles successfully with -pedantic.
	  - `image2d<int_u8> lena = load("lena.pgm");' works.
	  - Multiplications and subtractions on 'vec' no longer
	    perform additions.
