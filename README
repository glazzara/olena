Introduction to Olena
=====================

Olena_, a platform dedicated to image processing.

.. _Olena: http://olena.lrde.epita.fr


--------
Overview
--------

Olena is a platform dedicated to image processing.  At the moment it is
mainly composed of a C++ library: Milena.  This library features many
tools to easily perform image processing tasks.  Its main
characteristic is its genericity: it allows to write an algorithm once
and run it over many kinds of images (gray scale, color, 1D, 2D, 3D,
...).

Olena is a project developed by the `EPITA Research and Development
Laboratory (LRDE)`__ since 1997.  We did numerous prototypes and
throwaway experiments before settling into the kind of programming
paradigm which is finally here.

__ http://www.lrde.epita.fr

We do our image processing research using this library, but most
importantly we have gathered (and still do) generic programming
expertise from the library development.

Yet, Olena is an ongoing development project.  Few algorithms or
definitions may change in a near future.  A list of potential changes
is maintained here :
http://olena.lrde.epita.fr/FeaturesSubjectToChange.

Likewise, the documentation does not cover the whole project yet.  In the
`doc/' directory you will find the first draft of a reference
manual.  It includes a quick reference guide and a tutorial.  This is a
good start.  In `milena/tools' and `milena/doc/examples' few sample
programs are available.  Most of them are already used to illustrate
the tutorial.  For the rest, we're afraid you will have to dig the
code or e-mail us.

   Please direct any question or comments to <olena@lrde.epita.fr>, or
<olena-bugs@lrde.epita.fr>.

   Olena also has a web page, located at

-----------------
Required Software
-----------------

Here is a non-exhaustive list of required software required to build
Olena successfully.

   * to compile the user examples:

        - a POSIX shell, like Bash

        - a decent C++ compiler, like GNU C++

        - a `make' utility, like GNU `make'

Optional:

   * to use various image types:

        - Magick++

        - libtiff

        - GDCM

   * To use graphical user interfaces with Scribo:

	- Qt


   * To recognize text with Scribo:

	- Tesseract


==================
Quick Start Manual
==================

This section summarizes the installation procedure.  For more
information about building and installing Olena, see the next
sections.

To install Olena on your system, create a `_build' directory (even
though it is not mandatory) and type in the classical sequence at the
command prompt::

        mkdir _build
	cd _build
	../configure
	make
	make install (as root)

Note that an installation is specific to the compiler used to install
it.  Indeed, the call to ``../configure`` enables some workarounds
and, consequently, users must compile with the same compiler to avoid
compatibility problems.

Between ``make`` and ``make install``, you may also want to run::

	make check

 ``make check`` will run the test suite to check the whole library.
Running the test suite may require up several hours.


=====================
Detailed Instructions
=====================

-------------
Configuration
-------------

In order to prepare the build process, you need to configure the source
tree.

   Assuming your Olena distribution is uncompressed in directory
`olena-1.0', follow these steps:

     % cd olena-1.0
     % mkdir _build
     % cd _build
     % ../configure

   The build process can be altered by a number of options you can pass
to the `configure' script.  The following sections describe them.

   Additionally, if you are an Olena maintainer (a person who runs
`make distcheck'), _prefer setting `CXXFLAGS' as an environment
variable_: the flags given on the command line to `configure' are not
propagated to recursive runs by `make distcheck'.  Or better: use the
environment CONFIG_SITE to set up a configuration environment (see
Autoconf's manual).


Verbose Display
===============

A more verbose display can be turned on by passing the
`--enable-verbose' flag to configure:

     % ../configure --enable-verbose

Before configuring files, configure will display a summary of the
configuration step.


Installation Path
=================

By default, Olena is installed in the standard "local" directory of
your system.  This is usually `/usr/local' under Unix.

   You can change this path with the following flag:

      --prefix=<installation prefix>


Compiler Selection and Compilation Flags
========================================

By default, `configure' will try to use the first C++ compiler it
encounters on your system.  If `CXX' is not set, it will look, in order,
for:

   - the value of the `CXX' environment variable,

   - the GNU C++ compiler (`g++'),

   - the `c++' or `gpp' commands on your system,

   - `aCC', the HP-UX standard C++ compiler,

   - the `CC', `cxx', `cc++' or `cl' commands on your system,

   - KAI's C++ compiler (`KCC'),

   - `RCC', `xlC_r' or `xlC'.

   You can override the detection system by passing your favorite
compiler name to `configure', as follows:

     % ../configure CXX=<your-favorite-C++-compiler>

   As an alternative, you can also set the environment variable `CXX'.


   For some compilers (GNU g++ and Intel's icpc to some extent) ,
`configure' will use default CXXFLAGS.  You can override the default
C++ flags by giving `configure' your selection of flags:

     % ../configure CXXFLAGS="<your-favorite-flags>"


Additional Components
=====================

In additional to Milena, several build targets can be enabled.  These
parts are called "components", and you can obtain a list of them by
running:

     % ../configure --help

Scribo
------

Scribo is an optional component of Olena providing Document Image
Analysis tools and routines. It is based on Milena.

To enable the installation of this module use::

       ./configure --enable-scribo

Swilena
-------

Swilena is an optional component of Olena exposing Milena to other
languages thanks to the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator
(SWIG_).

.. _SWIG: http://www.swig.org

For the moment, only some Python_ bindings are provided.  They are
disabled by default because they require extra dependencies (SWIG and
Python).

.. _Python: http://www.python.org

To enable the installation of this module use::

       ./configure --enable-swilena

Tools
-----

Sample tools are shipped with the tarball.  To enable the installation of
these tools use::

       ./configure --enable-tools

Applications
------------
Sample applications are shipped with the tarball.  To enable the
installation of these applications use::

       ./configure --enable-apps

Trimesh
-------

Trimesh, a third-party library that we have been using to manipulate
3D meshes, is shipped with Olena.  (We will probably drop Trimesh from
the distribution someday.)  To enable it, use::

       ./configure --enable-trimesh

Input/output libraries
----------------------

To read/write TIFF images with Olena, libtiff is required.  If
``configure`` is unable to find libtiff on your system, you can help
it by specifying the base directory of libtiff, e.g.::

       ./configure --with-tiff=/usr/local

To read/write DICOM images with Olena, GDCM is required.  Likewise,
you can tell ``configure`` where to find it by giving its install
prefix, e.g.::

       ./configure --with-gdcm=/usr/local

Olena uses the Magick++ API provided by ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick
to read and write images in common formats.  As for other optional
dependencies, you can specify where such a package is located (if
needed) at configuration time, using either::

       ./configure --with-imagemagickxx=/usr/local/

or

       ./configure --with-graphicsmagickxx=/usr/local/

respectively.

If ``configure`` finds both ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick in your
system (either automatically or because you used one of the above
flags), the former is chosen by default.  If you want to select
GraphicsMagick instead, tell configure explicitly that you do not want
to use ImageMagick.  For instance, in the case where configure is able
to discover GraphicsMagick by itself, the following command line is
enough::

       ./configure --with-imagemagickxx=no

Otherwise, it suffices to combine it with the option telling where
GraphicsMagick is located::

       ./configure --with-imagemagickxx=no --with-graphicsmagickxx=/usr/local

Other libraries
---------------

The Boost Tuple library is used to implement a tuple accumulator
class.  This project is a part of the Boost libraries; you can help
configure find these libraries using the `--with-boost flag':

       ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/


--------
Building
--------

Once your build directory is `configure'd, you can run

     % make

to recursively build all the selected components.


   Additionally, you can build and run the test suite with:

     % make check

However, this process is time- and memory- consuming, and you probably
do not need it except if you are developing/debugging Olena.


----------
Installing
----------

To install the Olena headers and additional files on your system, run:

      % make install

from the build directory.

   If not overridden with `--prefix', this will install:

   * the headers in `/usr/local/include/mln/',

   * some applications and tools in `/usr/local/bin/',

   * sample images and meshes in `/usr/local/share/olena/images/',

   * the documentation in `/usr/local/share/doc/olena/`

And optionally:

   * Swilena's Python bindings in `/usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages/',

   * Trimesh programs in `/usr/local/bin/',

   * Trimesh libraries in `/usr/local/lib/',

   * Trimesh headers in `/usr/local/share/trimesh/',


   You can later remove Olena from your system by running

      % make uninstall

from the build directory (if you have kept it).  We recommend the use
of GNU Stow (or any similar program) during the installation of Olena,
to make the uninstallation of Olena easier.

===========================  =============================================


According to the wanted features, some dependencies may be required:


To enable I/O with TIFF images, `libtiff`_ must be installed.

.. _libtiff: http://www.libtiff.org/

To enable I/O with GDCM images, `GDCM`_ must be installed.

.. _GDCM: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/gdcm/

To support many image formats in Olena's I/O system, `Magick++`_ must
be installed.

.. _Magick++: http://www.imagemagick.org/Magick++/

The Boost Tuple Library from the `Boost`_ Project is needed if you
want to support tuple accumulators.

.. _Boost: http://www.boost.org/

Apart from GDCM, these dependencies are commonly provided by the
package management systems (e.g., Debian's APT, Mac OS X's Mac Ports,
etc.).  We recommend using package managers instead of installing
dependencies by hand.
