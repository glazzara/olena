# `@abs_builddir@/python' and `@abs_srcdir@/python' are for the *.py
# files, and `@abs_builddir@/python/.libs' for the *.so files.  We
# used to rely on a module called `ltihooks' to teach the `import'

# interfaces (with the `%import' keyword), we must add the `.libs'
# directory to SWILENA_RUBY_PATH so that the Ruby interpreter can load
# the corresponding dynamic module(s) (SWIG's `%import' statements
# generate code in dynamic modules that bypass Ruby's `Kernel.require'
# mechanism).
