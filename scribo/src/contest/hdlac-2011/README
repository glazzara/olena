Historical Document Layout Analysis Competition

* Description
This paper presents an objective comparative evaluation of layout
analysis methods for scanned historical documents. It describes the
competition (modus operandi, dataset and evaluation methodology) held
in the context of ICDAR2011 and the International Workshop on
Historical Document Imaging and Processing (HIP2011), presenting the
results of the evaluation of four submitted methods. A commercial
state-of-the-art system is also evaluated for comparison. Two
scenarios are reported in this paper, one evaluating the ability of
methods to accurately segment regions and the other evaluating the
whole pipeline of segmentation and region classification (with a text
extraction goal). The results indicate that there is a convergence to
a certain methodology with some variations in the approach. However,
there is still a considera-ble need to develop robust methods that
deal with the idiosyn-crasies of historical documents.
