%**************************
\doxysection{generality}{Generality}
The following tutorial explains the basic concepts behind Olena and how to use
the most common objects and routines.
This tutorial includes many code examples and figures. In order to make this
tutorial easier to understand, we will mainly talk about 2D images. This is
not so restrictive since 1D, 3D, $n$D images behave the same way.


Since examples are based on 2D images pixels are actually "points" however we
will call them "sites" which is the most generic name.\newline

Here is also a list of common variable name conventions:
\begin{figure}[ht!]
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Object} & \textbf{Variable name} \\ \hline
  Site & p                            \\ \hline
  Value & v                           \\ \hline
  Neighboor & n                       \\ \hline
  A site close to another site p & q  \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{figure}

Olena is organized in a namespace hierarchy.  Everything is declared by Olena
within the 'mln::' namespace, and possibly a sub-namespace such as
'\namespace{mln::arith::}' (arithmetic operations on images), '\namespace{mln::morpho::}' (morphological
operations), etc. Usually, the namespace hierarchy is mapped to the mln
directory tree. For the sake of simplicity, we will neglect the '\namespace{mln::}'
prefix in all the code examples.

Methods provided by objects in the library are in constant time. If you need
a specific method but you cannot find it, you may find an algorithm which can
compute the information you need.

%**************************
\doxysection{dirtree}{Directory hierarchy}
Olena's tarball is structured as follow:

\begin{itemize}
  \item milena
    \begin{itemize}
%      \item apps :
      \item doc
	\begin{itemize}
	  \item benchmark: set of benchmark.
	  \item examples: more examples.
	  \item oldies: partialy not updated documentation. Not recommended for new users.
	  \item technical: technical doc.
	  \item tutorial: code sample and tutorial.
	\end{itemize}
      \item img: a set of sample images.
      \item mesh: a full example which uses Olena.
      \item mln: the library. Contains only headers.
      \item tests: test suite.
%      \item tools :
    \end{itemize}
  \item swilena: Python bindings for Olena.
\end{itemize}

\doxysection{compilehint}{Writing and compiling a program with Olena}

Before writing your first program, please be aware of these hints:

\begin{itemize}
  \item By default, Olena enables a lot of internal pre and post conditions.
  Usually, this is a useful feature and it \should be enabled. However, it can heavily
  slow down a program though so these tests can be disabled by compiling
  using \code{-DNDEBUG}.
  \begin{verbatim}
$ g++ -DNDEBUG -Ipath/to/mln my_program.cc
  \end{verbatim}
%$

  \item If you decide to use optimization flags to compile for debugging,
  prefer using \code{-O1}. It is much faster to compile and it gives good
  performance results.

\end{itemize}

\doxychapter{site}{Site}

Usually, when talking about images, we think about common images composed of a
set of pixels.
Since Olena is generic, we want to support many kind of images, even images
which are not composed of a set of points, such as images having images as sites.

In order to express this genericity, we have the ``site'' concept.
This concept allows us to divide a pixel into two information:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The pixel location, e.g. its coordinates (the site itself).
  \item The value.
\end{itemize}

Let's say we have a 2D grid like this:

\begin{center}
\doxyimg{2dgrid}{3cm}
\end{center}

On such a regular grid, in 2D, we usually use a 2D point as a site which
means we have the following equivalence:

\begin{center}
  Intersection $\equiv$ point2d (2D site) $\equiv$ center of a pixel
\end{center}

The site does not store any value but refers to an area where we will be able
to read its value.

Sites may have a different types, depending on the image type:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Name & Description \\
\hline
\type{point2d} & 2D point on a regular grid \\
\type{point} & Generic point ($n$D) on a regular grid \\
\type{algebra::vec} & Algebraic vector \\
\type{util::vertex} & Graph vertex \\
\type{util::edge} & Graph edge \\
\end{tabular}

%FIXME: [Illustration : grille + intersection + pmin() + pmax() + distance entre
% 2 points en x et en y = 1]\\


%====================================
\clearpage
\newpage
\doxychapter{siteset}{Site set}

Site sets are used:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To define an image definition domain.
  \item As Site container.
\end{enumerate}

They do not actually store any image value. They only store site information.

Here is a list of all the site set concepts which can be found in
core/site\_set:

\begin{tabular}{|l|p{8cm}|}
\hline
Site set    & Description \\
\hline

p\_array    & site array. \\
\hline
p\_box	    & compact domain defined on a regular grid (in 2D, a rectangle). \\
\hline
p\_if	    & site set verifying a predicate. \\
\hline
p\_queue    & site queue. \\
\hline
p\_run	    & site range. \\
\hline
p\_runs	    & site range set. \\
\hline
p\_set	    & mathematical site set. \\
\hline
p\_vaccess  & site set ordered by value. \\
\hline
p\_edges    & set of graph edges associated to sites. \\
\hline
p\_vertices & set of graph vertices associated to sites.\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

All site sets are iterable. More detailed explanations are available in section \doxyref{iterators}.

%**************************
\doxysection{sitesetinterface}{Basic interface}
Common basic interface:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|p{4cm}|}
\hline
Return Type & Name & Arguments & Const & Comments \\ \hline

bool & is\_valid & - & X & Returns true if it has been initialized. The
default constructor does not initialize it. \\ \hline

bool & has & const P\& p & X &  \\ \hline
\end{tabular} \\


%**************************
\doxysection{sitesetopinterface}{Optional interface}
Site sets may have other methods depending on their type: \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|p{4cm}|}
\hline
Return Type & Name & Arguments & Const & Comments \\ \hline

size\_t & nsites & - & - & Return the number of sites. \\ \hline
const Box\& & bbox & - & X &  Bounding box. Available only on grid site sets.
\\ \hline
\end{tabular} \\

The previous methods are available depending on the site set. A box
will have the bbox() method since it can be retrieved in constant time: a box
is it's own bounding box.

\doxycode{box2d-bbox}
Output:
\doxyoutput{box2d-bbox}

A \type{p\_array} does not have the bbox
method since its sites do not have to be adjacent. Maintaining such information, in
order to keep getting the bbox in constant time, would be time and memory
consuming. Instead of providing a method directly in \type{p\_array}, an algorithm is
available if this information is needed.
\type{p\_array} and \type{box} both have a nsites method since the internal structure allows a
constant time retrieval.

\doxycode{parray-bbox}
Output:
\doxyoutput{parray-bbox}

%**************************
\doxysection{definition}{Definition}
An image is composed both of:
\begin{itemize}
\item A function
\begin{doxymath}
ima : \left\{
  \begin{array}{lll}
    Site &\rightarrow & Value \\
    p & \mapsto & ima(p)
  \end{array}
\right.
\end{doxymath}
\item A site set, also called the "domain".
\end{itemize}

%**************************
\doxysection{imatypes}{Possible image types}

Here is a short list of the main/usual image types you may want to use with
Olena: \\
\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Name & Description \\
\hline
\type{image1d} & 1D image \\
\type{image2d} & 2D image \\
\type{image3d} & 3D image \\
\type{flat\_image} & Constant value image \\
\type{image\_if} & Image defined by a function \\
%FIXME & FIXME \\
\end{tabular}

%**************************
\doxysection{imapossvalues}{Possible value types}

Every image type \must take its type of value as parameter.
The value type can be one of the builtins one:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \type{bool}
  \item \type{char}
  \item \type{unsigned}
  \item \type{int}
  \item \type{short}
  \item \type{long}
  \item \type{float}
  \item \type{double}
\end{itemize}

Other data types are also available:

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Value type & underlying data type \\
\hline
\type{float01\_8} & \type{unsigned long} \\
\type{float01\_16} & \type{unsigned long} \\
\type{float01\_f} & \type{float} \\
\type{gl8} & \type{unsigned char} \\
\type{gl16} & \type{unsigned short} \\
\type{glf} & \type{float} \\
\type{hsi\_d} & \type{double} \\
\type{hsi\_f} & \type{float} \\
\type{int\_s8} & \type{char} \\
\type{int\_s16} & \type{short} \\
\type{int\_s32} & \type{int} \\
\type{int\_u8} & \type{unsigned char} \\
\type{int\_u16} & \type{unsigned short} \\
\type{int\_u32} & \type{unsigned int} \\
\type{rgb16} & \type{mln::algebra::vec$<$unsigned short$>$} \\
\type{rgb8} & \type{mln::algebra::vec$<$unsigned char$>$} \\
\end{tabular} \\


All these types are available in mln/value and accessible in the
\namespace{mln::value} namespace.
Most of the time, the name of the header which \must be included to use one of these data
types is actually ``type\_name.hh". For instance, for \type{rgb8} the header will be
\header{rgb8.hh}.



%**************************
\doxysection{imadomain}{Domain}
The site set contains the sites which compose the image. Sites are based on a
grid so the image depends on that grid as well.
It means that a 2D images can only be defined by sites based on a 2D grid.
Likewise, an \type{image2d} will always have its bouding box defined by a \type{box2d}.

Being defined on a grid means that the image can be defined anywhere.
For instance, defining a 2D image with a \type{box2d} starting from point (-20, -20)
  to (-3, 5) is completely valid.

The following example shows that the definition domain and the site set are
exactly equivalent.

\doxycode{ima2d-1}
Output:
\doxyoutput{ima2d-1}


To know if a site belongs to an image domain or not, a method ``\code{has()}'' is
available.
\doxycode{point-1}
Output:
\doxyoutput{point-1}

Since the notion of site is independent from the image it applies on, we can
form expressions where a site passed to several images:
\doxycode{ima2d-4}
Output:
\doxyoutput{ima2d-4}


%================================================
\doxysection{imaborder}{Border and extension}
Olena provides extension mechanisms for the
image domain. In the library, both the concept of border and of extension can be encountered.
These concepts are useful in many algorithms and can avoid costly tests while
working with sites located on image edges.

%FIXME: We should be more precise about what is a border, what is an extension.
% For example, we could say that an extension contains sites that are not included
% in the domain.

\doxysubsection{imabordersection}{Image border}

A border is a finite extension provided to a basic image type, such as
\type{image2d}. By default, every image is created with a border. The default width is
defined through the global variable \var{border::thickness} defined in
\header{mln/border/thickness.hh}. Since this is a variable, it can be changed
as shown in the following example.

\doxycode{borderthickness}

Output:

\doxyoutput{borderthickness}

It is important to note that to display the border in the ouput, we use a
special debug function, \code{debug::println\_with\_border}. Indeed, the border and the
extension are considered as part of an image only in the algorithms. They are
ignored while saving or printing an image.

Some operations can be performed on the border. The functions are located in
\hpath{mln/border}.\\

%
\bigskip
%
\begin{tabular}{l|p{8cm}}
Routine & Description \\
\hline
adjust & Increase the border thickness if it is inferior to a minimum. \\
duplicate & Assign the border with the duplicate of the edges of this image.\\
equalize & Equalize the border of two images so that their size is equal and is
at least a minimum size.\\
fill & Fill the border with a given value.\\
find & Find the border thickness of an image.\\
get & Get the border thickness of an image.\\
mirror & Fills border using nearer pixels with a mirroring effect.\\
resize & Set image border to a specific size.\\
\end{tabular} \\


\doxysubsection{imextgeneral}{Generality on image extension}

On morphed images, described in section \doxyref{imamorphed}, the border concept
does not exist and is generalized to the extension concept.
A simple example of a morphed image is a sub-image. A sub image does not have
border nor extension by default.
Thanks to \header{mln/core/routine/extend.hh}, an extension can be defined through a
function. This means that the extension can be infinite.
Another point is that an image can be used as extension. For instance, in the
case of a sub-image, you may be interested in extending the sub-image with the
image itself.

The extension supports the following operations. These functions are located in
\hpath{mln/extension}.\\

%
\bigskip
%
\begin{tabular}{l|p{10cm}}
Routine & Description \\
\hline
adjust & Adjust the extension given a structural element.\\
adjust\_duplicate & Adjust the size of the extension given a structural element and duplicate the image inner boundary.\\
adjust\_fill & Adjust the size of the extension given a structural element and fill it with a value.\\
duplicate & Duplicate the values of the image inner boundary in the extension.\\
fill & Fill the extension with a given value.\\
\end{tabular} \\


In order to extend an image, a routine \code{extend} is available in
\hpath{mln/core/routine/extend.hh}. The routine \code{extended\_to} may
also help during debug. It allows to extend the image domain to a larger
one. The values associated to the new sites comes from the extension.

\doxysubsection{extexample}{Different extensions}

Let's say we have want to extract a sub domain from an image. In the following
example, \var{ima\_roi} holds several small rectangles from the original image.
\doxycode[2]{extend}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c c c}
    \doxyimg{small-enlarged}{3cm} & ~\huge{$\rightarrow$}~ & \doxyfigure[1]{extend}{3cm} \\
    \var{lena} & & \var{ima\_roi} (black color means the sites are not included in the domain) \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


Then, we may extend this sub image with one of the three following extension type.

\doxysubsubsection{extval}{Extension with a value}

Let's extend with the value \code{literal::blue}.
\doxycode[3]{extend}
\doxyfigure[2]{extend}{3cm}

Note the use of the \code{extended\_to()} routine. We used a larger bbox to
extend the image domain. That is the reason why the image is surrounded by the
extension value, blue.

\doxysubsubsection{extfun}{Extension with a function}

Let's use the following function:
\doxycode[1]{extend}
\doxycode[4]{extend}
\doxyfigure[3]{extend}{3cm}

\doxysubsubsection{extima}{Extension with an image}

Let's extend with the original image, \var{lena}.
\doxycode[5]{extend}

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c c}
    \doxyfigure[4]{extend}{3cm} & \doxyfigure[5]{extend}{3cm} \\
    \var{ext\_with\_ima}, the extended image. & The actual data in the domain (light) with its extension (dark) \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


%----------------
\subsection*{IMPORTANT NOTE}
Many times, you may want to check if a site is part of the image before applying
a treatment. All images provide a method ``\code{has(Site)}'' which can return this
information.
\textbf{Be careful though, calling \code{has()} on the image returns ``true'' if
  the given site is part of the domain OR the the extension/border}. All
  algorithms in Olena call that method which means that all the algorithms take
  in consideration the extension/border if it exists. The default border
  thickness is set to 3 as shown by the following example.

\doxycode{ima-has}

Output:

\doxyoutput{ima-has}

Most of the time, this is the good behavior. For instance, if a rotation
is applied to an image, sites which were not previously in the domain
will be part of it. Thanks to the extension/border, these sites will be
associated to the value of the extension/border.

In the following example, the extension is set to a constant color \var{yellow}.
It means that whatever the new sites computed through the rotation, it will be
part of the image and a value will be available. Site which were previously in
the extension/border, will be associated to \var{yellow} in the output image.

\doxycode{ima2d-rot}

Output:

\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{c c}
\doxyfigure[1]{ima2d-rot}{3cm} & \doxyfigure[2]{ima2d-rot}{3cm} \\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\var{ima1} and its border before rotation (left) and \var{ima2}
  and its border after rotation (right).} \\
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

Sometimes taking the domain in consideration  may not be the expected behavior.
If you do not want to use the extension/border for a specific routine, simply
restrict the image to its domain.


\doxycode{extension-ignore}

Note that:
\begin{center}
\code{ima.domain().has()} $\equiv$ \code{(ima | ima.domain()).has()}
\end{center}

%================================================
\doxysection{imaio}{Load and save images}

Currently, Olena supports the following input image formats:
\begin{itemize}
  \item PBM
  \item PFM
  \item PGM
  \item PNM
  \item PPM
\end{itemize}

This support is provided through two headers for each type, \header{save.hh} and
\header{load.hh}.
They are located in \hpath{mln/io/$<$image-format$>$/}.

Once the right header is included, the image can be loaded:

\doxycode{ima-load}

Note that each format is associated to specific image value types:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\\hline
Format & Value type \\ \hline
PBM & bool \\
PFM & float, double, float01\_* \\
PGM & unsigned, long, int, int\_u*, gl* \\
PNM & See PGM, PBM and PPM \\
PPM & rgb* \\
\end{tabular}

\doxycode{ima-save}
%

%================================================
\doxysection{imacreate}{Create an image}

Loading an image is not mandatory, an image can be created from scratch. There
are two possibilites to do so:

\doxycode{ima2d-2}

\var{img1a} has no data and its definition domain is still unset.  We do
not know yet the number of sites it contains. However, it is really useful to
have such an "empty image" because it is a placeholder for the result of some
processing, or another image. Trying to access the site value from an empty
image leads to an error at run-time.
\var{img1b} is defined on a domain but does not have data yet.\\

An image can also be created and initialized at the same time:
\doxycode[1]{labeling-compute}
It constructs the following image: \\
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[1]{labeling-compute}{3cm}
\end{center}

Sometimes, you may want to initialize an image from another one:
\doxycode{ima2d-7}
\var{img2b} is declared without specifying a domain. Its border size is set to
the default one, e.g 0. By using \code{initialize()}, \var{img2b} is initialized
 with the same domain and border/extension as \var{img2a}. The data is not
 copied though. Other routines like \code{data::fill()} can be called in order to
 do so (See also \doxyref{fillop}).


%================================================
\doxysection{imaaccessmodval}{Access and modify values}

There are several ways to access/modify an image ``\var{ima}'':
\begin{itemize}
\item \code{opt::at(ima, x, y, \dots)}
\item \code{ima(Site)}
\end{itemize}

Most of the time, images can be modified and these two methods can be used both
to read a value and modify it. Both methods are equivalent.
\doxycode{ima2d-3}
Output:
\doxyoutput{ima2d-3}

Usually, you will want to use the functional way, ``\code{ima(Site)}'', more
particularly while iterating over all the sites through an iterator. This use
case will be detailed further in section \doxyref{iterators}.



%================================================
\doxysection{imasize}{Image size}
Most typical image types owns special methods to retrieve the image size.

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Image type & Methods \\
\hline
image1d & length()\\
image2d & ncols(), nrows()\\
image3d & ncols(), nrows(), nslis() \\

\doxychapter{winneigh}{Structural elements: Window and neighborhood}

In Olena, there are both the window and neighborhood concept. A window can be
defined on any site around a central site which may also be included.
A neighborhood is more restrictive and \must not include the central site.
Therefore these two concepts are really similar and are detailed together in
this section.

By default, structural elements are centered. The central site is located at the
origin of the grid: ``\var{literal::origin}''. With \type{image2d}, the central site is
(0,0). Centered structural elements \must have an odd size.

\subsubsection{Windows}

There are several ways to define a new window.
The first and the most common way is to declare a window variable and insert
dpoints:
\doxycode{win-create-1}
This code creates the following window where ``X'' is the central point from
which the window is computed:
\doxyoutput{win-create-1-display}

Another way to define the same window is to provide a bool array:
\doxycode{win-create-2}

\textbf{Note that despite the different ways of defining these windows,
  ``var{win}'' == ``\var{win2}''}.
The boolean array \must always have an odd size.
While creating a windows thanks to a bool array/matrix, the window's center is the
central site of the array/matrix.

%of having non-square windows such as:}

\doxychapter{sitesandco}{Sites, psites and dpoints}


%**************************
\doxysection{sitessite}{Need for site}

As we have seen before, an image is usually defined on a grid. It has associated
data and a site set which defines the domain of the image on that grid.
Usually, we need to access a value by its coordinates. With default images it
can be done easily, at no cost.

Example with an \type{image2d}:
\doxyoutput{ima2d-display-1}

The site \var{x} is the point (0, 1).  The image values are stored in a
multi-dimensional array. The point coordinates can be used directly. The site
(0, 1) \textbf{is} the point (0, 1) and the data is stored at row 0 and column
1.

Here we have:

  \type{I::site} == \type{I::psite} == \type{point2d}

where, roughly, \type{point2d} = \{ row, column \}.

%**************************
\doxysection{sitespsite}{Need for psite}

Sometimes, accessing a value in constant-time complexity, O(1), is not
possible with a site object.

Let's have a small example. Define a function returning a value for a given
point:
\clearpage
\doxycode{fun-p2v-1}

So, for each point having (0, x) as coordinate, this function will return 8,
otherwise it will be 9.

Then, define a \type{p\_array} with few \type{point2d}:
\doxycode{parray-append}

Now, create a point-wise image from this function and this \type{p\_array}:
\doxycode[1]{mln_var}

\var{ima} is actually that image:
\doxyoutput{ima2d-display-2}

However, in memory, since it is based on a \type{p\_array}, sites are stored in a
vector.

The site x is the point (3, 7) which corresponds to the cell 1 in the
\type{p\_array}.
\doxyoutput{parray-display-1}

Obviously, we cannot check in constant time whether the site \var{x},
  \type{point2d} here,
is part of that image or not: knowing the point coordinates is not enough.
That's why we need a different mechanism in order to access this information:
the psites.

Here we have:

  \type{I::site} $==$ \type{point2d}  but  \type{I::psite} $==$
  \type{pseudo\_site$<$point2d$>$}

where, roughly, \type{pseudo\_site$<$point2d$>$} $=$ \{ i\_in\_p\_array, p\_array\_ptr
\}.

Psites contains all the needed information to access the values in
constant-time.

%**************************
\doxysection{sitespsitensite}{From psite to site}

In the last example there was an image of type \type{I} such as \type{I::site}
!= \type{I::psite}.
In that case, an object of type \type{I::psite} is actually convertible towards an
object of type \type{I::site}.  Furthermore, a \type{psite} shall behave as if it was a
\type{site}.

Design note: it seems impossible to offer through the interface of
some \type{psite} what is expected from its corresponding \type{site}.  For instance, when a
site has a given feature, say a method "\code{m}", then this
method has to appear in the \type{psite} interface. However, thanks to
inheritance, we fetch an interface and an implementation that delegates
to the site.

For instance, in the last example, \type{I::psite} has a method \code{row()} because
\type{I::site}, \type{point2d}, provides such a method.

How it works: a \type{psite} inherits from \type{internal::site\_impl$<$site$>$} which is
specialized for every site type; for instance,
	    \type{internal::site\_impl$<$point2d$>$}
owns the method ``\code{coord row() const}'' which is defined as
``\code{return exact(this)-$>$to\_site().row()}''.

%**************************
\doxysection{sitesdpoint}{Dpoint}
Dpoints are relative sites. They are usually used in window and neighborhood
definitions. Since the central site is not constant, windows and neighborhoods
\must be recomputed and dpoints help in doing that.

Output:
\doxyoutput{dpoint-1}



%====================================

\newpage
\doxychapter{iterators}{Iterators}

Each container object in Olena like site sets or images have iterators.
The iteration mechanism for images is directly derived from the mechanism
for site sets.

There are usually three kinds:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{fwd\_iter}, depends on the container,
\item \textbf{bkd\_iter}, iterates like forward but to the opposite way,
\item \textbf{iter}, usually the same as fwd\_iter. It is guaranteed to
iterate all over the elements.
\end{itemize}
Every iterable object have these three kinds of iterator. There are all
bidirectional containers.
Whatever the iterator used, the basic iterator has the only property of
browsing every site once.

The iterator type name depends on the data pointed by it: \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|p{4cm}|}
\hline
Data type & Iterator Names \\ \hline
Site & fwd\_piter, bkd\_piter, piter \\ \hline
Value & fwd\_viter, bkd\_viter, viter \\ \hline
Neighboors & fwd\_niter, bkd\_niter, niter \\ \hline
\end{tabular} \\

As you may have noticed, according to the data type, the word ``iter'' is prefixed
by the usual name variable used for that data type. Sites variables are usually
called ``p'' so the proper iterator is ``type{piter}''. (See the foreword)\\


An iterator has the following interface: \\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|p{4cm}|}
\hline
Return Type & Name & Arguments & Const & Comments \\ \hline

void & start & - & - & \\ \hline
void & next & - & - & \\ \hline
bool & is\_valid & - & - & Return false if created with the default
constructor and not associated to a proper container.\\ \hline
\end{tabular} \\


Example of different forward iterations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item box2d: from top to bottom then from left to right.
  \item p\_array$<$point2d$>$: from left to right.
\end{itemize}

A \code{for\_all()} macro is available to iterate over all the sites: \\

\doxycode{forall-piter}
Output:
\doxyoutput{forall-piter}

Note that when you declare an iterator, prefer using the ``\code{mln\_*iter}'' macros.
They resolve the iterator type automatically from the given container type
passed as parameter. These macros can be used with any container like images or
site sets.

Here follow an example with the implemantions of the most basic routines which
use the \code{for\_all()} loop: \code{data::fill()} and \code{data::paste()}.

\doxycode{fill}

\doxycode{paste}

Important note: macros for iterators exist in two versions:
``\code{mln\_*iter}'' and ``\code{mln\_*iter\_}''. The difference is that the
first version \must be used in templated function whereas the second one \must be
used in non templated functions.

If you want a list of all the macros available in Olena, please refert to
section \doxyref{macros}.

\clearpage
\doxychapter{imamemmgmt}{Memory management}

In the Olena library, all image types behave like image2d:
\begin{itemize}
\item An "empty" image is actually a mathematical variable.

      $\rightarrow$ just think in a mathemetical way when dealing with images;

\item No dynamic memory allocation/deallocation is required.
    the user never has to use "new / delete" (the C++ equivalent for the C
    "malloc / free") so she does not have to manipulate pointers or to directly
    access memory.

    $\rightarrow$ Olena prevents the user from making mistakes;

\item Image data/values can be shared between several variables and the memory
    used for image data is handled by the library.

    $\rightarrow$ Memory management is automatic.
\end{itemize}

%----------------
\subsection*{Exemple with image2d}

Images do not actually store the data in the class. Images store a pointer
to an allocated space which can be shared with other objects. Once an image is
assigned to another one, the two images share the same data so they have the
same ID and point to the same memory space.
Therefore, assigning an image to another one is NOT a costly operation. The new
variable behaves like some mathematical variable.  Put differently it is just a
name to designate an image:
\doxycode{ima2d-5}

If a deep copy of the image is needed, a \code{duplicate()} routine is available:
\doxycode{ima2d-6-clone}
Output:
\doxyoutput{ima2d-6-clone}

\hline
\end{tabular} \\

%**************************
\doxysection{fillop}{Fill}
First, create an image:
\doxycode[1]{fill-call-1}

Memory has been allocated so data can be stored but site values
have not been initialized yet.  So we fill \var{imga} with the value 'a':

\doxycode[2]{fill-call-1}

The \code{fill()} algorithm is located in the sub-namespace "\namespace{mln::data}" since this
algorithm deals with the site values.

The full name of this routine is \code{mln::data::fill()}.
To access to a particular algorithm, the proper file shall be included.
The file names of algorithms strictly map their C++ name; so
\namespace{mln::data::fill} is defined in the file \header{mln/data/fill.hh}.

%----------------
\subsection*{Note}
Most algorithms in Olena are constructed following the classical scheme: "output
algo(input)", where the input image is only read. However some few algorithms
take an input image in order to modify it.  To enforce this particular feature,
the user shall explicitly state that the image is provided so that its data is
modified "read/write". The algorithm call shall be \code{data::fill(ima.rw(),
val)}. When forgetting the \code{rw()} call, it does not compile.

\doxycode[3]{fill-call-1}

%**************************
\doxysection{pasteop}{Paste}
We then define below a second image to play with.  As you can see this image has
data for the sites (5, 5) to (14, 14) (so it has 100 sites).

\doxycode{paste-call-1}
Output:
\doxyoutput{paste-call-1}

%Before pasting, the couple of images looked like:

%FIXME : ajouter des zolies zimages.

%so after pasting we get:

%FIXME : ajouter des zolies zimages again.

%----------------
\subsection*{Note}
With this simple example we can see that images defined on different domains (or
set of sites) can interoperate.  The set of sites of an image is defined and
can be accessed and printed. The following code:

\doxycode{domain-display}

Gives:
\doxycode{domain-display}

The notion of site sets plays an important role in Olena. Many tests are
performed at run-time to ensure that the program is correct.

For instance, the algorithm \code{data::paste()} tests that the set of sites of \var{imgb}
(whose values are to be pasted) is a subset of the destination image.



%====================================
\doxysection{blobs}{Blobs}

\code{labeling::blobs()} is used to label an image. It returns a new image with the
component id as value for each site. The background has 0 as id therefore the
component ids start from 1.

Consider the following image:
\doxycode[1]{labeling-compute}

Output: \\
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[1]{labeling-compute}{3cm}
\end{center}

Then label this image thanks to \code{labeling::blobs()}:
\doxycode[2]{labeling-compute}

Output: \\

\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[2]{labeling-compute}{3cm}
\end{center}

Note that this routine returns the number of components in its third parameter.
This parameter \must be of the same type as the returned image value.


%**************************
\doxysection{logicalnot}{Logical not}
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Header} & mln/logical/not.hh \\

  \textbf{Full namespace} & mln::logical \\

  \textbf{Routine(s)} & not\_(),
			not\_inplace() \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bigskip

This small routine only works on binary images. It performs a point-wise
"logical not" and therefore "negates" the image. There are two versions of that
algorithm: a version which returns a new image and another which works in place.
Example:

Make a binary image:
\doxycode[1]{logical-not}
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[1]{logical-not}{3cm}
\end{center}

Return the result in a new image:
\doxycode[2]{logical-not}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c c}
\doxyfigure[1]{logical-not}{3cm} & \doxyfigure[2]{logical-not}{3cm} \\
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\var{ima} (left) and \var{ima_neg} (right) after having
  called logical::not\_().} \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Or, work in place:
\doxycode[3]{logical-not}
Then, \var{ima} looks like:
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[3]{logical-not}{3cm}
\end{center}


%**************************
\doxysection{compute}{Compute}

There are several flavour of the compute routine, depending on what the kind of
elements it computes.

\begin{tabular}{l|p{8cm}}
\hline
labeling::compute() & compute an accumulator for each component in a labeled
image. \\

data::compute() & compute an accumulator on the values of an image.  \\
\end{tabular}

\doxysubsection{accu}{Accumulators}
An accumulator is a special object accumulating data while iterating all over
the image values or sites. Hereby follows a list of accumulators available in
Olena.

%----------------
\subsubsection*{Accumulators on sites}
\begin{tabular}{l|p{8cm}}
Name & Description \\
\hline
bbox & Bounding boxes\\
count\_adjacent\_vertices & Count adjacent vertices\\
count & Count the number of sites\\
height & \\
volume & \\
\end{tabular}

%----------------
\subsubsection*{Accumulators on values}
\begin{tabular}{l|p{8cm}}
Name & Description \\
\hline
histo & Histogram \\
max & Max value \\
max\_h & Max value (Hexa)\\
mean & Mean value\\
median\_alt & Median\\
median\_h & Median (Hexa)\\
min & Min value\\
min\_h & Min value (Hexa)\\
min\_max & Min and Max value\\
rank\_bool & \\
rank & \\
rank\_high\_quant & \\
sum & Sum the values\\
\end{tabular}

%----------------
\subsubsection*{Special accumulators}
\begin{tabular}{l|p{8cm}}
Name & Description \\
\hline
pair & Pair of accumulators\\
tuple & $n$-uplets of accumulators\\
\end{tabular}

Each accumulator can be used in \code{*::compute()}.
It exists two versions of each accumulator.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \namespace{mln::accu::*}, this version require the site or value type as parameter.
  For instance, for the bbox accumulator, the type would be
  \type{accu::bbox<mln\_psite(I)>}, where \type{I} is the type of the image on which it will be
  computed.
  \item \namespace{mln::accu::meta::*}, this is usually the easiest version to use. The type
  of site or value do not need to be specified and will be deduced at compile
  time. For the bbox accumulator, the accumulator type would be
  \type{accu::meta::bbox}.
\end{itemize}

Note that when an accumulator is passed to \code{*::compute()}, it \must be instanciated.You cannot write:
\doxyrawcode{accu-wrong-instantiation}
Instead, you \must write:
\doxycode{accu-right-instantiation}

\doxysubsection{exlblcompute}{Example with labeling::compute()}

In this example we will try to retrieve the bounding box of each component in an
image.

Consider the following image:
\doxycode[1]{labeling-compute}

Then label this image thanks to \code{labeling::blobs()}:
\doxycode[2]{labeling-compute}
Output:
\doxyfigure[2]{labeling-compute}{3cm}

Then, use \code{labeling::compute()} with the bbox accumulator:
\doxycode[3]{labeling-compute}

\code{labeling::compute()} holds an accumulator for each component, which means it
returns an array of accumulator results.
In this case, it returns an array of \type{box2d}.

\textbf{Important note:} since \code{labeling::blobs()} labels the component from 1 and
set the background to 0, we will want to iterate from 1 to nlabels included.
\doxycode[4]{labeling-compute}
Output:
\doxyoutput{labeling-compute}


\subsection{Routines based on accumulators and *::compute()}
In order to make the code cleaner, small routines are available for the
most used accumulators.

Currently there are the following routines:\\

\begin{tabular}{l|p{8cm}}
Name & Description \\
\hline
nsites & Return the number of sites of an image or a site set.\\
mean & Return the mean of the values of an image.\\
min\_max & Return the min and max values of the values of an image.\\
sum & Return the sum of the values of an image.
\end{tabular}

These routines can be found in \hpath{mln/geom} and in \hpath{mln/estim}.
For example, with \code{geom::nsites()} simply write:
\doxycode{estim-sites}

%====================================
\doxysection{partima}{Working with parts of an image}

Sometimes it may be interesting to work only on some parts of the image or to
extract only a sub set of that image. Olena enables that through the
operator '$|$'.

Three kinds of that operator exist:\\

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|p{4cm}|}
\hline
Prototype & Comments \\ \hline

Image $|$ Sub Domain & Create a new image.\\ \hline
Image $|$ Function\_p2b & Do not create a new image but create a morpher.\\
\hline
Function\_p2v $|$ Sub Domain & Do not create a new image but create a morpher.\\
\hline
\end{tabular} \\

A Sub Domain can be a site set, an image or any value returned by this
operator.
For a given site, \type{Function\_p2v} returns a value and \type{Function\_p2b} returns a
boolean. These functions are actually a sort of predicate. A common
\type{Function\_p2v} is \code{pw::value(Image)}. It returns the
point to value function used in the given image. C functions can also be used as
predicate by passing the function pointer.

You can easily get a \type{Function\_p2b} by comparing the value returned
by a \type{Function\_p2v} to another Value.
The following sample codes illustrate this feature.

In order to use C functions as predicate, they \must have one of the following
prototype if you work on 2D images:
\doxycode{predicate-1}
Of course, you just need to change the point type if you use another image
type. For instance, you would use \type{point3d} with 3D images.
The returned value type \type{V} for \type{Function\_p2v} depends on the image value type.
With \type{image2d$<$int$>$}, \type{V} would be \type{int}.

In this section, all along the examples, the image \var{ima} will refer to the
following declaration:
\doxycode[1]{fill-part-image}
Output:
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[1]{fill-subdomain}{3cm}
\end{center}

\doxysubsection{restrictsiteset}{Restrict an image with a site set}
A simple example is to fill only a part of an image with a specific value:
\doxycode[2]{fill-part-image}

Output:
\doxyoutput{fill-part-image}

\doxysubsection{restrictpred}{Restrict an image with a predicate}
In the following example, we aim at extracting a component from an image and
create a new image with it.

First, find and label the components.
\doxycode[2]{fill-subdomain}
Output:
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[2]{fill-subdomain}{3cm}
\end{center}

Then, restrict the image to the sites being part of component 2.
\doxycode[3]{fill-subdomain}

\var{lbl\_2} is a new image. \var{lbl\_2} looks like:
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[3]{fill-subdomain}{3cm}
\end{center}

Finally, create a new color image, fill it with black and fill the sites part of
component 2 with red.
\doxycode[4]{fill-subdomain}
Output:
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[4]{fill-subdomain}{3cm}
\end{center}

The previous example can be written more quickly:
\doxycode[2]{fill-subdomain-shorter}

\doxysubsection{restrictcfun}{Restrict an image with a C function}
In this example, the image is restricted to its odd lines. A new image is
created in which odd lines are in red and others in black.

Here is the simple C function used as predicate:
\doxycode[1]{fill-imageif-cfun}

Restrict the image with it:
\doxycode[3]{fill-imageif-cfun}

Output:
\begin{center}
\doxyfigure[1]{fill-imageif-cfun}{3cm}
\end{center}
%
\medskip

%
%----------------
\subsection*{Important note}
When writing:

\doxyrawcode{ima2d-restricted-1}

\var{sub\_D} \must be included in \code{ima.domain()}.

Let's have an image, \var{imab}, like this:
\doxyoutput{ima2d-display-output-1}

Extract a sub image from \var{imab} with sites having their value set to 1.
\doxycode[2]{mln_var}
Then, \var{imab1} looks like:
\doxyoutput{ima2d-display-output-2}

Now, if we want to extract a sub image it may fail, depending on the site set
used:
\doxyrawcode{ima2d-restricted-2}

If you do not want this constraint, you may want to use an alternative
operator:
\doxyrawcode{ima2d-restricted-3}

%FIXME
%In that case there is no restriction on the domain at all and the following example will work.
%\doxycode[3]{mln_var}
%Output:
%\doxyoutput{mln_var}

%With this operator, an intersection is applied on the image domain and the
%site set.

\doxychapter{graphandima}{Graphs and images}

%FIXME: REWRITE

%**************************
\doxysection{graphdesc}{Description}
Olena enables the possibility of using graphs with images.
Graphs can help you to handle directly parts of an image and represent their
relationship.
Specific data can be associated to each vertex and/or edges.

%FIXME: Add more explanations?

%**************************
\doxysection{graphexample}{Example}

First, create a graph which looks like the following:

\doxyoutput{graph-output-1}

First we need to add vertices:

\doxycode[2]{graph-data}

Finally, populate the graph with edges:
\doxycode[3]{graph-data}

Now there is a graph topology and we want to associate elements of this graph
to a site in the image.
The idea is to use specific site sets such as \type{p\_vertices} and
\type{p\_edges}.
Let's associate the vertices with sites. To do so we need a function which maps
a vertex id to a site, e.g. a \type{point2d} here.
\doxycode[4]{graph-data}

Then declare a \type{p\_vertices}:
\doxycode[5]{graph-data}

Thanks to the \type{p\_vertices} there is now a mapping between vertices and sites.
We may want to map data to it. The idea is to provide a function which returns
the associated data according to the site given as parameter. Combining this
function and the \type{p\_vertices}, we get an image which can be used with
algorithms and \code{for\_all} loops.

\doxycode[1]{graph-data}
\doxycode[6]{graph-data}

Output:
\doxyoutput{graph-data}

Note that like any image in Olena, graph images share their data. Therefore,
while constructing a graph image from a graph and a function, the graph is not
copied and this is NOT a costly operation.

Of course, creating a graph image is not necessary and you can work directly
with the graph and container/function mapping sites and data.

\doxycode{graph-iter}
Output:
\doxymoutput[1]{graph-iter}

Graphs have iterators like any other site sets and also provide
specific iterators in order to iterate over graphs in a more intuitive way.

Iteration over the adjacent edges of all the vertices:
\doxycode[2]{graph-iter}
Output:
\doxymoutput[2]{graph-iter}

Iteration over the adjacent edges of all the edges:
\doxycode[3]{graph-iter}
Output:
\doxymoutput[3]{graph-iter}


Iteration over the adjacent vertices of all the vertices:
\doxycode[4]{graph-iter}
Output:
\doxymoutput[4]{graph-iter}

%FIXME talk about p\_vertices and p\_edges.

\doxychapter{compilerrors}{Common Compilation Errors}

In this section, the most common compilation errors are gathered and explained.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{error: 'check' is not a member of 'mln::metal::not\_equal$<$bool, bool$>$} \\
    \textbf{error: 'check' is not a member of 'mln::metal::converts\_to$<$mln::value::rgb$<$8u$>$, unsigned int$>$'} \\

    The routine does not support a given image with such a value type
    or an automatic conversion from the image value type to the
    expected value type is not available.


  \item
    \textbf{error: using 'typename' outside of template} \\

    Macros like \code{mln\_site} or \code{mln\_domain} can only be
    used in templated functions. In order to use them in a
    non-templated function, a `\_' must be appended to the macro
    name. For instance : \code{mln\_site\_} and \code{mln\_domain\_}.

\end{itemize}
